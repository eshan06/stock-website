# stock-website
Just a website I created to display stock information.

This website uses HTML and CSS for the frontend along with Flask for Python to connect it to the backend which was coded in Python. The backend uses plotly, pandas_datareader, yahoo_finance and some other libraries to generate data for stocks and construct graphs for them. Some of the code for styling and generating some stuff was taken off of stack overflow. Thanks.

requirements.txt:
